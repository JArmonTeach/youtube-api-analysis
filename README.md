# youtube-api-analysis

## Project Description
This Python3 project in Jupyter Lab is an analysis of Jacksonville Jaguars YouTube channel.

Python 3.8.5 was used so as to learn its basic syntax and semantics to retrieve video data and channel data using the Youtube Data API.

A challenge that came about was the over use of the tokens from the YouTube API which caused the operations of the code to not execute after several runs. This feature will be helpful for the future to realize how many token requests can be made to the Youtube API.
